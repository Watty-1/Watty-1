‚Ä¢ Using Linux commands to manage file permissions

Task 1. Create a new directory
First, you must create a dedicated subdirectory called logs, which will be used to store all future log files.

Create a new subdirectory called logs in the /home/analyst directory.
The command to complete this step:

mkdir logs
Copied!
List the contents of the /home/analyst directory to confirm that you‚Äôve successfully created the new logs subdirectory.
The command to complete this step:

ls
Copied!
The output should list the original three directories and the new logs subdirectory:

logs notes reports temp

Create a new directory
Task 2. Remove a directory
Next, you must remove the temp directory, as you‚Äôll no longer be placing items in it.

Remove the /home/analyst/temp directory.
The command to complete this step:

rmdir temp
Copied!
List the contents of the /home/analyst directory to confirm that you have removed the temp subdirectory.
The command to complete this step:

ls 
Copied!
The temp directory should no longer be listed:

logs notes reports

Remove a directory
Task 3. Move a file
The Q3patches.txt file contains notes taken on third-quarter patches and is now in the correct reporting format.

You must move the‚ÄØ Q3patches.txt file from the notes directory to the‚ÄØreports directory.

Navigate to the /home/analyst/notes directory.
The command to complete this step:

cd /home/analyst/notes
Copied!
The previous command used the absolute path, you could use the relative path as follows:

cd notes
Copied!
Move the Q3patches.txt file from the /home/analyst/notes directory to the /home/analyst/reports directory.
The command to complete this step:

mv Q3patches.txt /home/analyst/reports/
Copied!
List the contents of the /home/analyst/reports directory to confirm that you have moved the file successfully.
The command to complete this step:

ls /home/analyst/reports
Copied!
When you list the contents of the reports directory, it should show that three quarterly report files are now in the reports directory:

Q1patches.txt Q2patches.txt Q3patches.txt 

Move a file
Task 4. Remove a file
Next, you must delete an unused file called tempnotes.txt from the‚ÄØ/home/analyst/notes directory.

Remove the tempnotes.txt file from the /home/analyst/notes directory.
The command to complete this step:

rm tempnotes.txt
Copied!
List the contents of the /home/analyst/notes directory to confirm that you‚Äôve removed the file successfully.
The command to complete this step:

ls
Copied!
No files should be listed in the notes directory.


Remove a file
Task 5. Create a new file
Now, you must create a file named tasks.txt in the /home/analyst/notes directory that you‚Äôll use to document completed tasks.

Use the touch command to create an empty file called tasks.txt in the /home/analyst/notes directory.
The command to complete this step:

touch tasks.txt
Copied!
List the contents of the /home/analyst/notes directory to confirm that you have created a new file.
The command to complete this step:

ls
Copied!
A file called tasks.txt should now exist in the notes directory:

tasks.txt


Create a new file
Task 6. Edit a file
Finally, you must use the nano text editor to edit the tasks.txt file and add a note describing the tasks you‚Äôve completed.

Using the nano text editor, open the tasks.txt file that is located in the /home/analyst/notes directory.
The command to complete this step:

nano tasks.txt
Copied!
Note: This action changes the shell from the normal Bash interface to the nano text editor interface.
Copy and paste the following text into the text input area of the nano editor:
  Completed tasks
  1. Managed file structure in /home/analyst
Copied!
Press CTRL+X to exit the nano text editor.
This triggers a prompt asking Save modified bufferer?

Press Y to confirm that you want to save the new data to your file. (Answering "no" will discard changes.)

Press ENTER to confirm that File Name to Write is tasks.txt.

Note: The recommended sequence of commands for saving a file with the nano text editor is to use CTRL+O to tell nano to save the file and then use CTRL+X to exit immediately.
In this web-based lab environment, the CTRL+O command is intercepted by your web browser and is interpreted as a request to save the web page. The sequence used here is a commonly used alternative that achieves the same end result.

Use the clear command to clear the Bash shell window and remove any traces of the nano text input area.

The command to complete this step:

clear
Copied!
Note: Most Bash shells typically handle the screen cleanup after you exit nano. In this lab environment, nano sometimes leaves some text clutter around the edges of the screen that the clear command cleans up for you.
Display the contents of the tasks.txt file to confirm that it contains the updated task details.
cat tasks.txt
Copied!
This file should now contain the contents of the tasks.txt file that you added and saved in previous steps:

  Completed tasks
   Managed file structure in /home/analyst

  2.ADD USERS WITH LINUX
  
  Task 1. Add a new user
A new employee has joined the Research department. In this task, you must add them to the system. The username assigned to them is researcher9.

Write a command to add a user called researcher9 to the system.
The command to complete this step:

sudo useradd researcher9
Copied!
Next, you need to add the new user to the research_team group.

Use the usermod command and -g option to add researcher9 to the research_team group as their primary group.
The command to complete this step:

sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9
Copied!
You could alternatively use the following variation of useradd when creating the user to perform both steps at once:

sudo useradd researcher9 -g research_team
Copied!
Click‚ÄØCheck my progress‚ÄØto verify that you have completed this task correctly.

Add a new user
Task 2. Assign file ownership
The new employee, researcher9, will take responsibility for project_r. In this task, you must make them the owner of the project_r.txt file.

The project_r.txt file is located in the /home/researcher2/projects directory, and owned by the researcher2 user.

Use the chown command to make researcher9 the owner of /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt.
The command to complete this step:

sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt
Copied!
Click‚ÄØCheck my progress‚ÄØto verify that you have completed this task correctly.

Assign file ownership
Task 3. Add the user to a secondary group
A couple of months later, this employee's role at the organization has changed, and they are working in both the Research and the Sales departments.

In this task, you must add researcher9 to a secondary group (sales_team). Their primary group is still research_team.

Use the usermod command with the -a and -G options to add researcher9 to the sales_team group as a secondary group.
The command to complete this step:

sudo usermod -a -G sales_team researcher9
Copied!
Note: Options for Linux commands are case-sensitive, so make sure you use a lowercase -a and an uppercase -G.
Click‚ÄØCheck my progress‚ÄØto verify that you have completed this task correctly.

Add the user to a secondary group
Task 4. Delete a user
A year later, researcher9, decided to leave the company. In this task, you must remove them from the system.

Run a command to delete researcher9 from the system:
sudo userdel researcher9
Copied!
This command will output the following message:

Userdel: Group researcher9 not removed because it is not the primary group of user researcher9.  
This is expected.

Note: When you create a new user in Linux, a group with the same name as the user is automatically created and the user is the only member of that group. After removing users, it is good practice to clean up any such empty groups that may remain behind.
Run the following command to delete the researcher9 group that is no longer required:
sudo groupdel researcher9
